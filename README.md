ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Christian!
I'm a self-taught developer with a strong passion for coding and problem-solving. I'm always exploring new technologies and working on projects to deepen my knowledge and improve my skills.

ðŸ’» Currently, I'm focused on learning Java and Spring Boot to build robust backends, but Iâ€™m also exploring other areas like web development, APIs, and databases. I enjoy tackling challenges and learning from every mistake along the way.

ðŸ”­ My goal is to continuously grow as a developer by building real-world projects and contributing to open-source communities. I believe in learning by doing, and you'll find a variety of projects hereâ€”some still in progress, as I'm always working to improve them.

ðŸŒ± I'm still learning, so any feedback or advice is always welcome. Let's connect, collaborate, and grow together!
