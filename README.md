### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm [Your Name]!

I'm a **self-taught developer** with a strong passion for coding and problem-solving. I'm always exploring new technologies and working on projects to deepen my knowledge and improve my skills.

ðŸ’» Currently, I'm focused on learning **Java** and **Spring Boot** to build robust backends, but Iâ€™m also exploring other areas like **web development**, **APIs**, and **databases**. I enjoy tackling challenges and learning from every mistake along the way.

ðŸ”­ My goal is to continuously grow as a developer by building real-world projects and contributing to open-source communities. I believe in learning by doing, and you'll find a variety of projects here some still in progress, as I'm always working to improve them.

ðŸŒ± I'm still learning, so any feedback or advice is always welcome. Let's connect, collaborate, and grow together!
